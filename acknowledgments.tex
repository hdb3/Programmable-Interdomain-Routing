{\centering \section*{Acknowledgements}}

I first acknowledge the support, and the belief in me, that I received from David, and from my partner.

\smallskip

My daughters supported and cared for me throughout this time, thank you!

\smallskip

I am grateful for the welcoming community in Lancaster University:
David (again), Nicholas, Matt, Arsham, Lyndon, Jamie and Jamie.

\smallskip

I am grateful for the support and guidance of my supervisors, whose patience went beyond the call of duty:
David (again), Nicholas (again), Haris and Vasileios.

\smallskip

Other colleagues, not part of the original welcoming party cannot be overlooked: Ben, Ellie, Rick, Ollie, Noor, Antonios, Mu Mu, Andreas, Steven, Utz, Paul, Andrew, Adrian, Nigel.

\smallskip

The opportunity to teach was an unexpected and rewarding aspect of my time in Lancaster.  Thank you for that.

\smallskip

I must also thank Alastair and Rick, from whom I learnt much more of BGP, and BGP implementation, than I ever could have imagined.

\smallskip

Lastly, I thank and acknowledge the wonderfully gifted and human community that created the programming language Haskell.  Without them, this work would not have been possible.

\smallskip

Oops!  Nearly forgot.  Jeremy (and Caitlin) at the Tap House, Mike and Cathy at Accidental, Nick at The Little Bear, and the community around The Snug at Carnforth helped to keep me sane(?) and grounded.  Thank you, too.
